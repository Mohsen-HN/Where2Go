# Where2Go
This project is a class project course of "Crowdsourcing and AI" at unige, that aims at using the crowd to validate the location of pictures taken from Instagram that have a location tag or hashtag. In this exciting crowdsourcing project, we aim to develop an AI solution to accurately geolocalize images of Swiss cities posted on social media.
